This is a repo for year 5 semester 2 labworks. Here you can see:
 - sava_graph - a project for labs 1-5 of PZKS2 course (Rusanova)
	In this program a task graph can be drawn (lab1) and three queues of tasks can be made. The tasks are sorted by:
	sort2 - decrease of task weight
	sort3 - adjacency decrease and, if the adjacency of two tasks is the same, the increase of critical path (by length)
	sort4 - decrease of critical path by time
	The generator (lab 5) creates a graph using parameters: number of nodes, minimal node weight, maximal node weight, correlation, min link weight and max link weight.
